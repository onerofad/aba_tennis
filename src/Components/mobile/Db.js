            description: '<p>Aba and its people are renowned for their innovation and doggedness. So, it’s no surprise that out of Aba has come the greatest innovation in professional sports in Nigeria, the Aba Premier League Table Tennis. We are convinced that there is no city in Nigeria today that is equipped like Aba to promote the development of professional sports as an industry for the benefit of all stake holders. Here are a few reasons to support this view</p>. Aba is relatively equidistance from several cities and state capitals, which ensures the mobility and supply of sports fans, a pool of talented athletes and other support professionals. Also, Aba’s Ariaria Market has proven capacity to supply indigenously produced sports shoes, sports clothing and sports equipment required for a sports economy to thrive. As labor always migrates to the place of highest reward, athletes flowing into Aba seeking rewards for their talent will be pleasantly surprised at Aba’s modern hospitality infrastructure of hotels, restaurants, and people ready to welcome them. The question probably on everyone’s mind is how and why should it be table tennis leading this dawn of professional sports and the development of the sports business economy in Nigeria? And our answer is why not? Table tennis has for long been one of the best administratively organised sports in Nigeria, it is participatory, resident in many homes, individualistic and has players spread across a much wider age range than many other sports.But can we execute on our promise of a professional table tennis league in Aba? Afterall this has never been done before? We believe that we have put in place the foundation to achieve this vision including physical and digital infrastructure, prize money, top of the range equipment, merchandise, and broadcast equipment. Ultimately our ability to fully execute to plan is dependent on the support of every stakeholder from the players to the fans, officials, regulators, broadcast partners, vendors, sponsors and of course our host city, Aba. This is a huge project and rightly so too. Sports is growing everywhere in the world and providing employment and reward to many. There is no reason why any athlete, sport, or city in Nigeria, shouldn’t be part of this growth. Our athletes are perhaps more gifted than many of today’s world champions. All that they require is the opportunity and reward for the display of their competitive talents and the entertainment that it provides to fans and viewers. Our ambition is to provide them with both the opportunity and reward beginning with table tennis and then on to other sports. Let us begin.',

            description: 'As part of programs to ensure top quality officiating at the Aba Premier League Table Tennis, a training clinic for tournament umpires and referees is scheduled to hold just before the tournament begins. The clinic will be facilitated by Nigeria’s foremost female ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) certified table tennis coach, Ifeoma Stella Isaac. According to Coach Ifeoma, “it is important that we introduce our players to the highest global standards of officiating so that they are ready to take on the world when they step out”. She emphasized that standard officiating plays a crucial role in making the Aba Premier League an international tournament within the shortest possible time. She continued by saying, “it is important that we facilitate the understanding of the game by the spectators as well, and one way of ensuring this, is through the provision of international standard officiating so that there are no misinterpretations of how points are won or lost, the conduct of players and the quality of equipment to be used”. Attending the training clinic is mandatory for any person wishing to serve as an umpire or referee during the tournament. Coach Ifeoma is also the tournament director of the Aba Premier League Table Tennis.',

The program which is called Program for Table Tennis Excellence (PTTE) will see the League extending invitation to heads of secondary schools in Aba to inform them about the scheme.
